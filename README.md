SQL Tables & Data for Countries / States / Cities
===================
Currently only USA Information, working on Mexico Information, and soon a Europe Tables

Countries Tables, contains cctld, and international phone codes (most of them)
Subregions (States) contains ISO 3166-2 code, name
Cities are grouped by country, and ISO 3166-2 code, and contains timezone and metro code.

Please if you want to contribute, please help me to complete with other countries/cities, and
